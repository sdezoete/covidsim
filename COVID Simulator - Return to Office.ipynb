    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will be based on discrete simulation with agents (people/employees) who can go through several states based on the SEIR model which is a model with the following states:\n",
    "* susceptible state: person can be infected \n",
    "* exposed : person is exposed and has a risk of being infected\n",
    "* infected: person is infected\n",
    "* recovered / fatal: person has recovered or passed away\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is based on the assumption that once recovered a person can not be infected again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key states, variables and distribution for the simulation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agents (N) = number of agents (employees) [integer]\n",
    "- Days (D) = number of days [integer]\n",
    "- Susceptible Agents (SA) = probability (part of population) agent will be susceptible for the virus [probability, Uniform Distribution]\n",
    "- Pre-Infected Agents = number of agents (employees) who are infected, but not aware\n",
    "- Interactions (I_lambda) = number of interactions sampled for each agent, each day [lambda, Poisson Distribution]\n",
    "- Interaction Agent (IA) = interaction is limited to one to one interactions, not taken into account group gatherings, etc., hence single interaction with a single agent in the population with equal probability [Agents (N), uniform distribution]<br>\n",
    "<b>NOTE:</b> Interaction is also not necessarily 'personal' interaction between two agents, it can be 'surface' interaction, e.g Agent A touches door handle and Agent B touches door handle almost immediately after Agent A.<br>\n",
    "- Interaction Mistake (IM) = probability that agent A was not uncareful [probability, Uniform Distribution]. Agent A only gets infected when this interaction was with an infected agent B. This is one-way only, if agent B was not careful, agent A will not be infected.\n",
    "- Agent Exposed (AE) = agent is exposed but not yet a carrier. In simulation it is assumed Infected Agent will start infecting others only the next day\n",
    "- Home Infections (HI) = probability agent get infected between days at home [probability, Uniform Distribution].\n",
    "- Agent Infected (AI) = agent is infected and will be infecting others during the incubation time\n",
    "- Incubation Time Mean (IT_mean) = mean of the time before infection is detected and agent is isolated from population (agents), [mean - Incubation Time]\n",
    "- Incubation Time Standard Deviation (IT_sd) = standard deviation of the time before infection is detected and agent is isolated from population (home or hospital) [standard deviation - Incubation Time]\n",
    "- RecoveryTime (RT) = lambda for recovery time [lambda, Exponential Distribution]\n",
    "- FatalityRate (FR) = probability infection is fatal [probability, Uniform Distribution]\n"
